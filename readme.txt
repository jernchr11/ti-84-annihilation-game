gshooter.8xp sends to your calc. MAYBE UNSTABLE.

gshooter.z80 is the source code. Read it in a text file or w/e suits your interests.
The code is fairly organized but I didn't make it flexible enough to implement cooler stuff. This was one of the main reasons I stopped coding it. 
Also some weird bugs that I never spent the time to fix.
